# Behavior Trees for Planet Wars

This project involves implementing a bot to play the Planet Wars game using Behavior Trees (BTs). Planet Wars is a real-time strategy game where players compete to conquer planets using fleets of ships. The goal of this project is to design a reactive bot that can win against a series of test bots.

## Introduction

In this project, you will develop a bot that plays Planet Wars by implementing a behavior tree (BT). The bot must successfully win against five predefined test bots. Behavior trees are a structured way to define complex behaviors, commonly used in games and AI applications. The project provides several utility functions and bot behavior components to get you started.

The competition consists of running bots pairwise on three randomly selected maps, with the class's best-performing bots earning extra credit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Java (for the Planet Wars game engine)
